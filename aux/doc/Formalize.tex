\section{FEM Solver Implementation} \label{sec:intro}
Full weak form:
\begin{equation}
	-\delta W = \underbrace{\int_{\Omega_0} \bm S : \delta \bm E \mathrm d V}_{-\delta W_{\text{int}}} \underbrace{- \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\bm b}_0^T \delta \bm u \mathrm d V - \int_{\Gamma_{0; \bm \sigma}} \hat{\bm t}_0^T \delta \bm u \mathrm d A}_{-\delta W_{\text{ext}}} \overset{!}{=} 0 .
\end{equation}
%
We neglect $\delta W_{\text{ext}}$ for now, and focus on internal work:
\begin{equation}
	-\delta W_{\text{int}} = \int_{\Omega_0} \bm S : \delta \bm E \mathrm d V \equiv \int_{\Omega_0} \delta \bm E : \bm S \mathrm d V \overset{!}{=} 0 ,
\end{equation}
due to symmetry of both tensors.

We use the linear (engineering) strain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:kinematicEngStrain}
	\bm E = \text{symmetrize}(\nabla \bm u) = \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \bm u + (\nabla \bm u)^T) ,
\end{equation}
as well as the linear St.Venant-Kirchoff constitutive relation
\begin{equation}
	\bm S = \bm C_{\text{VK}} : \bm E ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	(C_{\text{VK}})_{ijkl} = \lambda \delta_{ij} \delta{kl} + \mu (\delta_{ik} \delta_{jl} + \delta_{il} \delta_{jk}) ,
\end{equation}
with the Lam\'e constants $\lambda$ and $\mu$.

\subsubsection{Discretization within an element}
We use the discretized quantities (technically they should have an "h" subscript, but we leave it away here because we do not handle the analytical quantities anyways)
\begin{align}
	u_i &= \sum_{k = 1}^{\text{nnode}} \mathrm N_k \mathrm d_{\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, i)} , \\
	\delta u_i &= \sum_{k = 1}^{\text{nnode}} \mathrm N_k \delta \mathrm d_{\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, i)} , \\
	x_i &= \sum_{k = 1}^{\text{nnode}} \mathrm N_k \mathrm X_{\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, i)} ,
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
	\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, i) = k \cdot \text{nnode} + i
\end{equation}
is the mapping from node $k$ and node-local (node-scoped) dof $i$ to the corresponding element-global (element-scoped) dof. The inverse of this mapping is
\begin{equation}
	\text{dof2nodeldof}(g) = \{\text{floor}(g/\text{ndofn}), \text{mod}(g, \text{ndofn})\} .
\end{equation}
%
Given the need for the gradient of the unknown displacement in \ref{eq:kinematicEngStrain}, we need to discretize it. In index notation,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial (\mathrm N \mathrm d)_i}{\partial x_j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{\text{nnode}} \frac{\partial \mathrm N_k}{\partial x_j} \mathrm d_{\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, i)} .
\end{equation}
%
Now, we can find the gradient of the shape functions from the parametric coordinates and (inverse) Jacobian:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \mathrm N_k}{\partial x_j} = \sum_{l = 1}^{\text{ndofn}} \frac{\partial \mathrm N_k}{\partial \xi_l} \frac{\partial \xi_l}{\partial x_j}.
\end{equation}
To find the inverse Jacobian, we need the Jacobian:
\begin{equation}
	J_{lj} = \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial \xi_l} = \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{\text{nnode}} \mathrm N_k \mathrm X_{\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, j)}}{\partial \xi_l} = \sum_{k = 1}^{\text{nnode}} \frac{\mathrm N_k}{\partial \xi_l} \mathrm X_{\text{nodeldof2dof}(k, j)}
\end{equation}
