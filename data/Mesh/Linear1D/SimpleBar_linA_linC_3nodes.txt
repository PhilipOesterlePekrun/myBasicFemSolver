// This problem consists of a simple 1D bar with:
// - Cross-sectional area A is a linear function of space (x)
// - Constitutive relation is linear (SVK but really just like spring because 1D) and is also a linear function of space
// - The discretization consists of 3 nodes, so 2 elements
// - There are no external forces; all boundaries have Dirchlet BCs
